# Kernels-Clustering
 Use methods of kernels for clustering and probability dense aproximation
<strong>Task 1)</strong>
<br>
Use a Gaussian Kernel to aproximate the probabilty dense of a uniformly distributed random variable in range [0, 1].
<br>
<strong>Task 2)</strong>
<br>
Try to divide 2 classes of 2-D vector data (stars, circles) again with the help of a gaussian kernel.
<br>
<strong>Task 3)</strong>
Try to split data into 2 categories with the K-means algorithm
